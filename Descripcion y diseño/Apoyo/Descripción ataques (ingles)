		- dnmap: Dnmap is a framework to distribute nmap scans among several clients. It reads an already created file with nmap commands and send those commands to each client connected to it.
		The framework use a client/server architecture. The server knows what to do and the clients do it. All the logic and statistics are managed in the server. Nmap output is stored on both server and client.
		Usually you would want this if you have to scan a large group of hosts and you have several different internet connections (or friends that want to help you).

		- Nmap: Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

		- rainbowcrack: RainbowCrack is a general propose implementation of Philippe Oechslin’s faster time-memory trade-off technique. It crack hashes with rainbow tables.
		RainbowCrack uses time-memory tradeoff algorithm to crack hashes. It differs from brute force hash crackers.
		A time-memory tradeoff hash cracker need a pre-computation stage, at the time all plaintext/hash pairs within the selected hash algorithm, charset, plaintext length are computed and results are stored in files called rainbow table. It is time consuming to do this kind of computation. But once the one time pre-computation is finished, hashes stored in the table can be cracked with much better performance than a brute force cracker.

		- flasm: Flasm disassembles your entire SWF including all the timelines and events. Looking at disassembly, you learn how the Flash compiler works, which improves your ActionScript skills. You can also do some optimizations on the disassembled code by hand or adjust the code as you wish. Flasm then applies your changes to the original SWF, replacing original actions.
		It's also possible to embed Flasm actions in your ActionScript, making optimizing of large projects more comfortable.
		Flasm is not a decompiler. What you get is the human readable representation of SWF bytecodes, not ActionScript source. If you're looking for a decompiler, Flare may suit your needs. However, Flare can't alter the SWF.

		- javasnoop: Normally, without access to the original source code, testing the security of a Java client is unpredictable at best and unrealistic at worst. With access the original source, you can run a simple Java program and attach a debugger to it remotely, stepping through code and changing variables where needed. Doing the same with an applet is a little bit more difficult.
		Unfortunately, real-life scenarios don’t offer you this option, anyway. Compilation and decompilation of Java are not really as deterministic as you might imagine. Therefore, you can’t just decompile a Java application, run it locally and attach a debugger to it.
		Next, you may try to just alter the communication channel between the client and the server, which is where most of the interesting things happen anyway. This works if the client uses HTTP with a configurable proxy. Otherwise, you’re stuck with generic network traffic altering mechanisms. These are not so great for almost all cases, because the data is usually not plaintext. It’s usually a custom protocol, serialized objects, encrypted, or some combination of those.
		JavaSnoop attempts to solve this problem by allowing you attach to an existing process (like a debugger) and instantly begin tampering with method calls, run custom code, or just watch what’s happening on the system.

		- sslh: Basically you can access your remote server/system via HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, OpenVPN and some other protocols. But the only problem is some internet service providers or your company firewalls don’t allow you to connect to remote servers/systems via these ports except some specific ports such as HTTP (80), HTTPS (443). So what if you want to access the servers via SSH when all the other ports are blocked?
		The only solution is that you can use the same port HTTPS (443), for SSH protocol. This is where a tiny tool called sshlh will help you to acheive this goal. It simply allows you to connect to the servers via SSH on port 443, while the web server is using the same port.

	    The main feature that makes Cisco-torch different from similar tools is the extensive use of forking to launch multiple scanning processes on the background for maximum scanning efficiency. Also, it uses several methods of application layer fingerprinting simultaneously, if needed. We wanted something fast to discover remote Cisco hosts running Telnet, SSH, Web, NTP and SNMP services and launch dictionary attacks against the services discovered.

	    - Fierce: First what Fierce is not. Fierce is not an IP scanner, it is not a DDoS tool, it is not designed to scan the whole Internet or perform any un-targeted attacks. It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both inside and outside a corporate network. Only those targets are listed (unless the -nopattern switch is used). No exploitation is performed (unless you do something intentionally malicious with the -connect switch). Fierce is a reconnaissance tool. Fierce is a PERL script that quickly scans domains (usually in just a few minutes, assuming no network lag) using several tactics.

	    - ace: ACE (Automated Corporate Enumerator) is a simple yet powerful VoIP Corporate Directory enumeration tool that mimics the behavior of an IP Phone in order to download the name and extension entries that a given phone can display on its screen interface. In the same way that the “corporate directory” feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from “VoIP Hopper” to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools.

		- braa: Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course making SNMP queries – but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process. Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.
		Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data types, and in any case cannot be stated ‘standard-conforming’! It was designed to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of my laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa – you HAVE to know the numerical values of OID’s (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0).

		- dbpwaudit: DBPwAudit is a Java tool that allows you to perform online audits of password quality for several database engines. The application design allows for easy adding of additional database drivers by simply copying new JDBC drivers to the jdbc directory. Configuration is performed in two files, the aliases.conf file is used to map drivers to aliases and the rules.conf tells the application how to handle error messages from the scan.
		The tool has been tested and known to work with:
		    Microsoft SQL Server 2000/2005
		    Oracle 8/9/10/11
		    IBM DB2 Universal Database
		    MySQL
		The tool is pre-configured for these drivers but does not ship with them, due to licensing issues.

		dnschef: DNSChef is a highly configurable DNS proxy for Penetration Testers and Malware Analysts. A DNS proxy (aka “Fake DNS”) is a tool used for application network traffic analysis among other uses. For example, a DNS proxy can be used to fake requests for “badguy.com” to point to a local machine for termination or interception instead of a real host somewhere on the Internet.
		There are several DNS Proxies out there. Most will simply point all DNS queries a single IP address or implement only rudimentary filtering. DNSChef was developed as part of a penetration test where there was a need for a more configurable system. As a result, DNSChef is cross-platform application capable of forging responses based on inclusive and exclusive domain lists, supporting multiple DNS record types, matching domains with wildcards, proxying true responses for nonmatching domains, defining external configuration files, IPv6 and many other features. You can find detailed explanation of each of the features and suggested uses below.
		The use of DNS Proxy is recommended in situations where it is not possible to force an application to use some other proxy server directly. For example, some mobile applications completely ignore OS HTTP Proxy settings. In these cases, the use of a DNS proxy server such as DNSChef will allow you to trick that application into forwarding connections to the desired destination.

		dnsspoof: Dnsspoof is a member of the Dsniff suit toolset and  works similarly to arpspoof . It lets you forge DNS responses for a DNS server on the local network . DNS runs on User Datagram Protocol (UDP), a connectionless protocol, a DNS client will send out a query and expect a response . The query is assigned a pseudo random identification number  which should be present in the answer from the DNS server. Then when the answer from the DNS server will be received , it will just have to compare both numbers if they’re the same, the answer is taken as valid, otherwise it will be simply ignored . The DNS protocol relies on UDP for requests (TCP is used only for zone transfers –> communications between DNS servers), which means that it is easy to send a packet coming from a fake IP since there are no SYN/ACK numbers (Unlike TCP, UDP doesn’t provide a minimum of protection against IP spoofing) .

		tcpflow: tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like tcpdump(4) shows a summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands TCP sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.

		rebind: Rebind is a tool that implements the multiple A record DNS rebinding attack. Although this tool was originally written to target home routers, it can be used to target any public (non RFC1918) IP address. Rebind provides an external attacker access to a target router’s internal Web interface. This tool works on routers that implement the weak end system model in their IP stack, have specifically configured firewall rules, and who bind their Web service to the router’s WAN interface. Note that remote administration does not need to be enabled for this attack to work. All that is required is that a user inside the target network surf to a Web site that is controlled, or has been compromised, by the attacker.

		tcpreplay: tcpreplay has evolved quite a bit over the years. In the 1.x days, it merely read packets and sent then back on the wire. In 2.x, tcpreplay was enhanced significantly to add various rewriting functionality but at the cost of complexity, performance and bloat. Now in 3.x, tcpreplay has returned to its roots to be a lean packet sending machine and the editing functions have moved to tcprewrite and a powerful tcpreplay-edit which combines the two.

This requires two important steps in order for the tool to traverse VLANs for unauthorized access. First, discovery of the correct 12 bit Voice VLAN ID (VVID) used by the IP Phones is required. VoIP Hopper supports multiple protocol discovery methods (CDP, DHCP, LLDP-MED, 802.1q ARP) for this important first step. Second, the tool creates a virtual VoIP ethernet interface on the OS. It then inserts a spoofed 4-byte 802.1q vlan header containing the 12 bit VVID into a spoofed DHCP request. Once it receives an IP address in the VoIP VLAN subnet, all subsequent ethernet frames are “tagged” with the spoofed 802.1q header. VoIP Hopper is a VLAN Hop test tool but also a tool to test VoIP infrastructure security.

		dns2tcp: Dns2tcp is a network tool designed to relay TCP connections through DNS traffic. Encapsulation is done on the TCP level, thus no specific driver is needed (i.e: TUN/TAP). Dns2tcp client doesn’t need to be run with specific privileges.
		Dns2tcp is composed of two parts : a server-side tool and a client-side tool. The server has a list of resources specified in a configuration file. Each resource is a local or remote service listening for TCP connections. The client listen on a predefined TCP port and relays each incoming connection through DNS to the final service.

		miredo: Miredo is a daemon program providing a Teredo tunnel service compatible with the "Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through NATs" Internet proposed standard (RFC 4380). It can provide either Teredo client or Teredo relay functionality.
		This is mostly useful to provide IPv6 connectivity to users behind NAT, most of which do not support IPv6 at all. Many NATs do not even support proto-41 forwarding, so it is not possible to set up a 6to4 or point-to-point IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnel through them.
		A Teredo relay is an IPv6 router which forwards IPv6 packets between the IPv6 Internet and Teredo clients by encapsulating these IPv6 packets over UDP/IPv4.
		A Teredo client is an IPv6-enabled host which is located behind an IPv4-only Network Address Translator (a.k.a. NAT), and encapsulates its IPv6 traffic inside UDP over IPv4 packets.
		A Teredo server is a special Teredo relay which is required for Teredo clients to setup their IPv6 connectivity through Teredo. A Teredo server must have to global static subsequent IPv4 addresses. It receives packets from Teredo clients and Teredo relays on UDP port 3544.

		proxytunnel: proxytunnel is a program that open a tunnel through a HTTPS proxy. 

		Fuente: http://linux.die.net/man/1/proxytunnel

		ptunnel: Ptunnel is not a feature-rich tool by any means, but it does what it advertises. So here is what it can do:
		Tunnel TCP using ICMP echo request and reply packets,
		Connections are reliable (lost packets are resent as necessary),
		Handles multiple connections,
		Acceptable bandwidth (150 kb/s downstream and about 50 kb/s upstream are the currently measured maximas for one tunnel, but with tweaking this can be improved further),
		Authentication, to prevent just anyone from using your proxy.

		Fuente: http://www.debianadmin.com/access-network-when-everything-else-is-blocked-using-ptunnel.html

		pwnat: pwnat is a tool that allows any number of clients behind NATs to communicate with a server behind a separate NAT with *no* port forwarding and *no* DMZ setup on any routers in order to directly communicate with each other. The server does not need to know anything about the clients trying to connect.
		Simply put, this is a proxy server that works behind a NAT, even when the client is behind a NAT, without any 3rd party.

		socat: How do I configure UNIX or Linux system to act as TCP port forwarder without using firewall? How do I install socat ( SOcket CAT ) multipurpose relay for bidirectional data transfer under Linux?
		You can use the utility called socat (SOcket CAT). This is just like the Netcat but with security in mind (e.g., it support chrooting) and works over various protocols and through a files, pipes, devices, TCP sockets, Unix sockets, a client for SOCKS4, proxy CONNECT, or SSL etc.

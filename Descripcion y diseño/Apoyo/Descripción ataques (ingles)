	- Information gathering:
		- dmitry: DMitry (Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool) is a UNIX/(GNU)Linux Command Line Application coded in C. DMitry has the ability to gather as much information as possible about a host. Base functionality is able to gather possible subdomains, email addresses, uptime information, tcp port scan, whois lookups, and more.

		- nmap: Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing.

It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.

		- javasnoop: Normally, without access to the original source code, testing the security of a Java client is unpredictable at best and unrealistic at worst. With access the original source, you can run a simple Java program and attach a debugger to it remotely, stepping through code and changing variables where needed. Doing the same with an applet is a little bit more difficult.
		Unfortunately, real-life scenarios don’t offer you this option, anyway. Compilation and decompilation of Java are not really as deterministic as you might imagine. Therefore, you can’t just decompile a Java application, run it locally and attach a debugger to it.
		Next, you may try to just alter the communication channel between the client and the server, which is where most of the interesting things happen anyway. This works if the client uses HTTP with a configurable proxy. Otherwise, you’re stuck with generic network traffic altering mechanisms. These are not so great for almost all cases, because the data is usually not plaintext. It’s usually a custom protocol, serialized objects, encrypted, or some combination of those.
		JavaSnoop attempts to solve this problem by allowing you attach to an existing process (like a debugger) and instantly begin tampering with method calls, run custom code, or just watch what’s happening on the system.

The idea is that we would send our target a link which routes them through to our website which automatically downloads and executes the exploit on the target system.  You can even clone a valid website so the target is less suspicious.  This becomes even more effective if you study your victims browser habits and clone one of their most frequently accessed sites.

		- bdfproxy: BDFProxy is a tool that has been developed from two different instruments. Initially, the author of BDFProxy Joshua Pitts created the tool called The Backdoor Factory that actually was designed to automate patching of the files in order to plug in backcodes which might be quite crucial for penetration testing. There is another one, mitmproxy, which is a Python proxy-server that can catch HTTP, change traffic on the fly, replay traffic, decode and render primitive data types. By means of crossing of those two tools we got BDFProxy.

		- hashdepp: Hashdeep is a program for recursively computing hashes with multiple algorithms simultaneously. It can also perform matching operations like the md5deep family of programs, but in a more powerful way. Hashdeep can perform an audit of hashes against a set of known hashess. With traditional matching, programs report if an input file matched one in a set of knows or if the input file did not match. It's hard to get a complete sense of the state of the input files compared to the set of knowns. It's possible to have matched files, missing files, files that have moved in the set, and to find new files not in the set. Hashdeep can report all of these conditions.

It targets a unique market of ‘offline’ analysts whose primary sources of information are not gained from the open-source intelligence side or can be programmatically queried.
